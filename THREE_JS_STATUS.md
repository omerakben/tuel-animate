# Three.js React 19 Compatibility Status

## Current Status: ⚠️ Temporarily Disabled

The Three.js components in this monorepo are temporarily disabled due to React 19 compatibility issues.

### Why Disabled?

- React 19 introduces `bigint` to the `ReactNode` type
- `@react-three/fiber` and `@react-three/drei` haven't updated for React 19 yet
- This causes TypeScript compilation errors

### What's Preserved?

- ✅ All Three.js component code is preserved (commented out)
- ✅ `@tuel/three` package structure maintained
- ✅ Mock components provide clear user feedback
- ✅ Zero-error build policy maintained

### Components Affected:

- `AnimatedText`
- `NoiseField`
- `FloatingObjects`
- `ParticleWave`
- `MorphingShapes`
- `ThreeOrbitScene`
- `PhantomGallery`

### Re-enablement Strategy:

1. Monitor Three.js ecosystem for React 19 updates
2. Test compatibility when updates are available
3. Uncomment exports in `packages/components/src/index.ts`
4. Remove mock imports from docs app
5. Update this status document

### Estimated Timeline:

- **Short term (1-2 months)**: @react-three/fiber React 19 support
- **Medium term (3-6 months)**: Full ecosystem compatibility
- **Re-enablement effort**: ~1 hour when ready

### Fallback Strategy:

If React 19 compatibility takes longer than expected, we can:

1. Create a separate Three.js branch with React 18
2. Use dynamic imports with version detection
3. Implement progressive enhancement patterns

## Decision: Keep & Handle Gracefully ✅

This approach maintains:

- **Code investment protection**
- **Future flexibility**
- **Professional degradation patterns**
- **Easy restoration path**
